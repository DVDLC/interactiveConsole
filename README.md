# Interactive console using NodeJS

My goal was to create an interactive console application, with options that can be selected with the arrow keys, numbers and with the space key when there are multiple options.

I used and learned these topics:

1. stdin
2. stdout
3. loops
4. Inquirer
5. JavaScript class
6. JSON Files
7. A lot of async y await
8. Transformations
